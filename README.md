# candlestick_generator
 A generator for candlestick charts. Useful for training stockmarket prediction algorithms on visual images.
 
 The generator fetches daily historical price data for a particular stock
 It then iterates through the data and creates candlechart plots for smaller periods 
 The candlechart plots are stored to disk along with a metadata  file that contains information on closeing price and possible price target.
 
The generator is still work in progress
